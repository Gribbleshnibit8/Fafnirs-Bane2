Long ago an ancient dragon, named Fafnir, stole a great hoard of gold. The dragon poisoned the land and killed all that approached his lair.
#
The only weapon that could kill Fafnir is the sword Gram, however the sword had been broken and scattered across the land.
#
You, Sigurd, must rouse your army, collect the shards of Gram, and slay Fafnir to establish your own kingdom.
